# Coursera-ML-Course
This repo documents my journey for following the [Machine Learning Course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) offered by Coursera as an introductory course to machine learning. It is a 11 week program which covers topics ranging from linear and logistic regression to neural networks. 

You can find all my code for the programming exercises under Exercise-Solutions.

<sup>All code is written in python instead of matlab/octave</sup>
